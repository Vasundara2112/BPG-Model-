üìä Business Plan Generator The Business Plan Generator is a Streamlit-based web application that generates structured business plans for various industries and sub-industries. It allows users to select predefined industries from a dataset or input custom values. If a matching business plan is not found in the dataset, the application leverages AI through LangChain to generate fallback predictions in a structured format.

üöÄ Features Industry Selection: Choose from predefined industries or add custom ones. Fallback Plan Generation: Automatically generates a business plan using AI when no matching data is found. Structured Output: Business plans are displayed in the format: --> Business Goals --> Challenges --> Target Audience --> Revenue Streams --> Profit Range Interactive UI: User-friendly interface powered by Streamlit. Customizable: Easily extendable for additional fields or functionalities.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used Streamlit: For the web application interface. Pandas: To handle and process the business dataset. LangChain: For fallback AI-based plan generation. Ollama: LLM model for generating fallback predictions. Python: Backend programming language.

üìÇ Dataset The application uses a CSV dataset containing structured business plans. The dataset includes fields such as:

Main Industry Sub-Industry Business Goals Challenges Target Audience Revenue Streams Profit Range You can replace the dataset with your own CSV file as long as it follows a similar structure.

üåü How It Works Workflow Diagram User Inputs -> Dataset Lookup -> Match Found? -> Yes -> Display Plan | No | AI Fallback | Generate Plan | Display Plan

Detailed Workflow

Industry Selection: Users select a Main Industry from a dropdown or type a custom value. Users then select a Sub-Industry from the options or type a custom value.
2.Dataset Lookup: The app checks the dataset for a match based on the selected Main Industry and Sub-Industry.

3.Matching Plan: If a match is found, the business plan details (Business Goals, Challenges, Target Audience, Revenue Streams, Profit Range) are displayed.

4.Fallback to AI: If no match is found, the app uses LangChain and an LLM (e.g., Llama2) to generate a structured fallback plan based on the selected inputs.

5.Structured Output: The AI-generated fallback plan adheres to the same format as the dataset: Business Goals Challenges Target Audience Revenue Streams Profit Range

üñ•Ô∏è Installation Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/business-plan-generator.git cd business-plan-generator

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application: streamlit run app.py Open your browser at the URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).

üìÑ Usage Upload Dataset (optional): If using a custom dataset, ensure it follows the structure of the default CSV file.

Select Main and Sub-Industry: Choose from the dropdowns or type custom inputs.

View Business Plan: The application will either display a matching plan or generate a fallback plan using AI.

Custom Fallback Generation: If no data matches, the AI fallback generates predictions in the same structured format as the dataset.

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Custom Dataset Replace the default dataset file (expanded_business_plans_final.csv) with your own CSV file. Ensure your CSV includes the following columns: Main Industry Sub-Industry Business Goals Challenges Target Audience Revenue Streams Profit Range

Adjusting the AI Model The AI model is configured via LangChain and Ollama (llm = Ollama(model="llama2")). To change the AI model, replace "llama2" with your preferred model.

Custom Prompts Update the LangChain prompt in the code to adjust how the AI generates fallback predictions.

üîß Example Input Main Industry: Technology Sub-Industry: SaaS

Output Business Plan: Business Goals: Scale operations, expand customer base, achieve $1M ARR in 2 years. Challenges: High competition, customer retention, pricing strategy. Target Audience: Mid-sized businesses needing workflow automation. Revenue Streams: Subscription plans, implementation services. Profit Range: $50K-$100K/month after scaling.

üõ°Ô∏è Future Enhancements Multi-Language Support: Support for business plans in different languages. Expanded Fields: Add more business plan components like marketing strategies or operational plans. Dynamic Dataset Updates: Allow users to upload new datasets directly via the app. Analytics: Add visual insights based on the dataset or generated plans. Cloud Deployment: Host the app on platforms like AWS, GCP, or Streamlit Cloud.

üôã FAQ

How accurate are AI-generated plans? The fallback plans rely on the LLM's training and the prompt's quality. Fine-tuning the model or using a better prompt can significantly improve accuracy.

Can I use my own AI model? Yes, you can replace the LLM used in the llm configuration with any model compatible with LangChain.

Can I add more industries and sub-industries? Absolutely! Just update the CSV dataset with new rows for your industries and sub-industries
